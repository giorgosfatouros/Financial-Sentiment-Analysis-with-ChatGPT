## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install requirements.txt
   ```

## Data

1. `sentiment_annotated_with_texts.csv`: Sentiment Annotated dataset of Forex news. Includes sentiment predictions from FinBERT. For more info check https://zenodo.org/records/7976208.
2. `prompts.json`: Includes the different prompts presented in the paper.
3. `sentiment_predictions_single_article.csv`: Contains the predictions from the prompts processing single headlines.
4. `sentiment_predictions_allday_articles.csv`: Contains the predictions from the prompts processing all the headlines per day (GPT-P5 and GPT-P6).



## Running the prompts.py 

To run the script and evaluate ChatGPT's performance on a sample row from the dataset.

Add your OpenAI API key to the `prompts.py` script:
Replace <ADD YOUR API KEY> in the script with your actual OpenAI API key.


```bash
python3 prompts.py
```

The script will print the sentiment predictions of ChatGPT for the specified row and compare them against the true sentiment and FinBERT's predictions.


## Running the results.py 
The script will print the comparative performance results of the models/prompts presented in the paper .

```bash
python3 results.py
```

## Helper Functions
`sentiment_to_numeric`: Converts sentiment labels to numeric values.
`get_sentiment`: Fetches sentiment predictions from ChatGPT based on the specified prompt.
